# XML to JSON CL Adaptor
This adaptor allows for converting of XML API's into JSON. This allows ChainLink nodes to use API's which use XML as a markup. It's built in Go using [go-json-rest](https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest).

## Dependencies
To be able to run this external adaptor, you need [Docker](docker.com) installed.

## Run the Adaptor
This adaptor is published on the public docker hub, so you just need to run the two following commands:
```bash
docker pull linkpoolio/xml-cl-ea
docker run -t -p 8080:8080 linkpoolio/xml-cl-ea
```

## Using the Adaptor
To ensure that the adaptor is working properly, the following call:

> http://localhost:8080/xmltojson?endpoint=http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=agencyList

Should result in something similar to the following:
```json
{
"body": {
        "-copyright": "All data copyright agencies listed below and NextBus Inc 2018.",
        "agency": [
            {
                "-tag": "string",
                "-title": "string",
                "-shortTitle": "string",
                "-regionTitle": "string"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Development
To run the external adaptor, clone the repo and run the following commands:
```bash
    go get
```

To run the unit tests, run the following:
```bash
    go test
```
